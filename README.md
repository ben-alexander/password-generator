## Password generator

Because I don't want to search for the bash formulation each time.

Based off [Randy Marsh's answer][1] on Stack Overflow; though with some changes.

Creates a crypotgraphically secure 32 (default) digit character password using the `letters()`, `digits()` and `punctuation()` methods of the Python `string()` class.
